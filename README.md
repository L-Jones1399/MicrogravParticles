The python file, micrograv.py, aims to simulate what would happen to particles trapped in a box in a microgravity environment if they are agitated by speakers.

Our hope with this simulation was to see particles agglomerate to the middle of the box, where they would be in the nodal point within the standing wave generated by the speakers. 

The results support this conclusion, with the particles forming and agglomerating in various places in the box.
